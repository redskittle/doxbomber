doxbomber
=========

A little php script that will paste false doxes to a variety of websites.



Release notes for v0.4: Made a few small revisions; added birthdays, random age selector, couple of other things; made the USERNAME section a bit easier to use; added some documentation to help users; added titles


Templates (tor): http://oukryuqqc7ffenin.onion/files/d156ae5c831315516d3a1ea8cb412396.zip

Templates (clearnet): http://oukryuqqc7ffenin.tor2web.org/files/d156ae5c831315516d3a1ea8cb412396.zip

Put all of the templates in a new subdirectory named "templates" in the same directory as the script.

Made by a couple of anons.

Legal: Do whatever you want. Rename it, rewrite it, fork it, whatever.

Templates taken from doxes on Pastebin, DOXBIN, etc.
